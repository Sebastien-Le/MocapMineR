# MocapMineR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

MocapMineR is an R package dedicated to the analysis of motion capture data. It was initially developed by Lou-Anne Guillotel and myself to analyze movements from blind Tae Kwon Do practitioners. The main idea, was to find a way to correct these practitioners automatically, based on graphical indicators. Actually, this package works for any kind of motion capture data.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Sebastien-Le/MocapMineR")
```
