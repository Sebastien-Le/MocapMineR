# MocapMineR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

MocapMineR is an R package dedicated to the analysis of motion capture
data. It was initially developed by Lou-Anne Guillotel and myself to
analyze movements from blind Tae Kwon Do practitioners. The main idea,
was to find a way to correct these practitioners automatically, based on
graphical indicators. Actually, this package works for any kind of
motion capture data.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
