# MocapMineR
MocapMineR is an R package dedicated to the analysis of motion capture data. It was initially developed by Lou-Anne Guillotel and myself to analyze movements from blind Tae Kwon Do practitioners. The main idea, was to find a way to correct these practitioners automatically, based on graphical indicators. Actually, this package works for any kind of motion capture data.
